## A small SQL databse
# Description
This database facilitates Clean Up Inc's collaboration with local Municipal councils to implement a Pay-As-You-Dump (PAYD) waste management program. It captures and manages data from sensor-equipped waste bins, using RFID technology to accurately track the type and weight of waste collected from households. The system maintains local authority information, street and property details, waste type categorization, and bin supply logistics. It ensures precise billing for residents based on their waste contributions, enhances waste management transparency, and optimizes operational efficiency for both Clean Up Inc and local councils.
