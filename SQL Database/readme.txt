##A small SQL databse
#Description
In this project, we designed a robust database system for Clean Up Inc (CUI), collaborating with local Municipal councils to implement a Pay-As-You-Dump (PAYD) program. Created a conceptual model integrating sensor-based waste bins with RFID technology for accurate invoicing based on waste type and weight. Managed local authority details, street and property information, waste types, and bin supply logistics. Enabled streamlined waste management, accurate billing, and operational efficiency, showcasing expertise in database design and real-world problem-solving.
