# Classic Tetris game

This project is a Classic Tetris Game developed using TypeScript, RxJS, and SVG graphics, showcasing the principles of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) for efficient state management and interactive gameplay. It features core Tetris mechanics such as block manipulation, collision detection, scoring, and the Super Rotation System (SRS) without wall kick for block rotation. The game allows players to score by arranging falling geometric blocks into complete lines, with difficulty increasing as levels progress through faster block speeds. Additional features include a hold function to save blocks for later use, a restart button for quick resets, and a system to track the highest score across game sessions. By leveraging RxJS, the game ensures real-time responsiveness, while SVG graphics create visually appealing visuals. This project highlights expertise in game mechanics, web development, and functional programming, reflecting a commitment to delivering an engaging and dynamic gaming experience.
